Session Initialization (Line ~2):
[ ] Issue: Session is simply started without regenerating the session ID after login or verifying its validity.
• Recommendation: Regenerate the session ID after a successful login to mitigate session fixation risks.
CORS Headers (Line ~3–7):
• Issue: The API allows any origin (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *), which may expose the API to cross-origin attacks if not intended.
• Recommendation: Limit allowed origins to trusted domains.
HTTP Method Handling and Input Data (Line ~16–20):
• Issue: The API accepts JSON input with file_get_contents("php://input") but does not thoroughly validate or sanitize the input data.
• Recommendation: Implement proper input validation and sanitization on all inputs.
Error Handling and Response Codes (Various Cases):
• Issue: Some endpoints set HTTP response codes (e.g., 401) without sending detailed error messages, which might lead to ambiguity or mislead error handling in clients.
• Recommendation: Standardize error messaging and use appropriate response codes to avoid exposing internal logic details.
auth_controller.php

Error Suppression with Ellipsis ({…}) Blocks:
• Issue: Several security-critical validations (e.g., checking if a session exists in logout, changePassword, etc.) are omitted, leaving potential gaps.
• Recommendation: Ensure all security checks are implemented and avoid skipping necessary validation logic.
Input Data Handling:
• Issue: Multiple endpoints rely on data from $data without complete sanitation.
• Recommendation: Validate and sanitize every input field before using it in database queries or other security-critical operations.

user.php

Incomplete SQL in create() (Line ~10):
• Issue: The SQL query for creating a user is incomplete and concatenates parts of the SQL string insecurely.
• Recommendation: Use a complete prepared statement with bound parameters for all fields to avoid SQL injection.
Password Handling in verifyPassword() (Line ~40):
• Issue: After a successful password check, session variables are set without additional measures like session regeneration.
• Recommendation: Regenerate the session ID upon login to reduce session fixation risks.
changeInfo() (Line ~90):
• Issue: The dynamic SQL built to update user info may lead to injection risks if not all input data is properly bound and validated.
• Recommendation: Construct queries with full prepared statements and bind all parameters instead of concatenating query parts.
db.php

Error Display in getConnection() (Line ~8):
• Issue: Catching the PDO exception and echoing the error message may leak sensitive database connection details.
• Recommendation: Log the error securely (e.g., to a file with restricted access) and display a generic error message to the user.
